# rtp (Robi-Transform-Project)
rtp, the first "integrated", "living robot" open source robot project. <br/>

What is "integrated"? <br/>
当我们在网上搜索开源机器人时，我们发现都是部分功能的代码和demo，我们不能找到一个完整的项目，直接下载到我们的树莓派上，上电，然后就可以动、可以玩了。
rtp已经做到这点了；事实上它已经可以动并说话了，它是基于ros的完整的机器人代码，找来1块树莓派，接上几个电机和喇叭，ok，它已经可以动、可以玩、可以愉快地添加自己的代码了；虽然粗糙但是基本满足这个需求了（子功能还需要各种完善）。<br/>
When we search for open-source robots online, we find that they are part of the robot code and demo, we can not find a complete project, download it directly to our raspberry pi, power on, and then  it can move, we can play.
Rtp has done this; in fact it has been able to move and talk, a integrated robot code bases on ros. Get a raspberry pi, connected a few motors and a speaker/microphone, ok, it's ready. You can play, change code, try again. Although rough but basically meet the needs of play it happily(sub-function also needs a variety of improvement).<br/>
<br/>
What is "living robot"? <br/>
想象一下当你养了一只兔子、或者一只蜥蜴作为宠物时，它们从来不会和你卖萌扮可爱，根本不会回答你任何或机智或愚蠢透顶的问题；但是我们还是养了这样的宠物；为什么？因为它是“活着的”的。rtp要人工创造这种Living的感觉，我们称之为“Living-Robot”：但是一旦实现得非常好的时候，它就有了某种“Magic”的感觉，这将非常好玩：人为地创造一种机器“生命”。好比面对Cozmo，你也会有一点这种感觉。<br/>
Imagine that if you have a rabbit or a lizard as a pet, they will never sell you cute, and will not answer any of your wit or stupid questions. But we still keep such a pet; why? Because it is "alive". Rtp is responsible to create the feeling of "alive", we call it "Living-Robot": but once achieved it will be very good, it has a "Magic" feeling and will be very fun: artificially create a mechanical  "life". Like when you facs Cozmo, you will have such similar feeling. <br/>

------------------------------------------------Technical & TODO-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Software: <br/>
1. Python / C <br/>
2. ROS & linux(debian/raspbian/ubuntu) <br/>
3. use speech recognization and aiml to dialog to make it more fun. <br/>
2. ai "heart" to act as a real interest "living" thing. <br/>
3. camera and face detection/recognization and sense of space where he is in. <br/>
4. add more sensors to make it complementary to our human body. <br/>
5. dnn to improve the user experience. <br/>

Hardware:  <br/>
1. Raspberry Pi 3B(pi 2B, or tk1 is also fine) + some sensor modules.  <br/>
2. use Robi or other humanid <br/>

This project is original for improving software and hardware to tranform/improve the lovely Robi robot. <br/>

The design of Robi is pretty good. We love it. But the software is not strong. This makes Robi not interest enough.   <br/>
The well looked robots in the world are only Nao and Robi. Nao is just "designed" but you cannot say it's kind of "Art", but to Robi we can feel "Art". 
How about the "Pepper"? Jesus, it's absolutely ugly and scared me with a big touch pad. It's even worse than the bandage on the back side of iphone 6:-)   <br/>
