# rtp:  
rtp is the first "integrated", "living robot" open source robot project.

What is "integrated"? 

What is "living robot"?


------------------------------------------------Technical & TODO-------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Software: <br/>
1. Python / C <br/>
2. ROS & linux(debian/raspbian/ubuntu) <br/>
3. use speech recognization and aiml to dialog to make it more fun. <br/>
2. ai "heart" to act as a real interest "living" thing. <br/>
3. camera and face detection/recognization and sense of space where he is in. <br/>
4. add more sensors to make it complementary to our human body. <br/>
5. dnn to improve the user experience. <br/>

Hardware:  <br/>
1. Raspberry Pi 3B(pi 2B, or tk1 is also fine) + some sensor modules.  <br/>
2. use Robi or other humanid <br/>

This project is original for improving software and hardware to tranform/improve the lovely Robi robot. <br/>
2017.2.7 <br/>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
The design of Robi is pretty good. We love it. But the software is not strong. This makes Robi not interest enough.   <br/>
The well looked robots in the world are only Nao and Robi. Nao is just "designed" but you cannot say it's kind of "Art", but to Robi we can feel "Art". 
How about the "Pepper"? Jesus, it's absolutely ugly and scared me with a big touch pad. It's even worse than the bandage on the back side of iphone 6:-)   <br/>
